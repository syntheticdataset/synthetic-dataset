# Synthetic Data Generation for Tabular, Classification, and Time-Series Labels

This repository contains a Python-based framework for generating accurate and safe synthetic datasets for tabular, classification, and time-series labeling tasks. It is designed to help researchers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers create high-quality, realistic datasets for training and evaluating their models while ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Features

1. **Tabular Data Generation**: Easily generate synthetic tabular datasets with customizable column types, distribution patterns, and correlations between variables.
2. **Classification Data Generation**: Create datasets for binary or multi-class classification tasks, controlling class imbalance and feature importance.
3. **Time-Series Data Generation**: Generate synthetic time-series datasets with user-defined seasonality, trend, and noise components.
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure data privacy by using differential privacy techniques and limiting the degree of similarity between the original and synthetic datasets.
5. **Flexible and Extensible**: The framework is designed to be easily extended and adapted to a wide range of data generation tasks, with support for custom data generation modules and integration with other data generation tools.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synthetic-data-generation.git
cd synthetic-data-generation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Refer to the provided examples and documentation for guidance on how to generate synthetic datasets for your specific use case.
```python
from synthetic_data import TabularDataGenerator, ClassificationDataGenerator, TimeSeriesDataGenerator

# Tabular data generation
tabular_gen = TabularDataGenerator(num_rows=1000)
tabular_data = tabular_gen.generate()

# Classification data generation
classification_gen = ClassificationDataGenerator(num_samples=1000, num_classes=3)
classification_data, labels = classification_gen.generate()

# Time-series data generation
time_series_gen = TimeSeriesDataGenerator(num_samples=1000, seasonal_period=12)
time_series_data = time_series_gen.generate()
```
